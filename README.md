# Lyft Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program
**This repository contains the code I completed for the virtual experience, which is designed to give hands-on experience with the tools and technologies used by Lyft's back-end engineers.**

## Tasks
The virtual experience program consists of a series of tasks that simulate real-world challenges faced by Lyft's back-end engineering team. Each task is designed to build upon the skills and knowledge you'll need to succeed as a back-end engineer at Lyft. The tasks may involve building new features, fixing bugs, or optimizing performance, depending on the specific module you are working on.

## Resources
In addition to the code and instructions provided in this repository, you'll have access to a number of resources to help you succeed in the virtual experience program. These resources may include online documentation, chat forums, and video tutorials. You should take advantage of these resources to supplement your learning and get the most out of the program.
