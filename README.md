# Lyft Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program
**This repository contains the code I completed for the virtual experience, which is designed to give hands-on experience with the tools and technologies used by Lyft's back-end engineers.**

## Tasks
The virtual experience program consists of a series of tasks that simulate real-world challenges faced by Lyft's back-end engineering team. Each task is designed to build upon the skills and knowledge needed to succeed as a back-end engineer at Lyft.

The tasks depend on the specific module being worked on and include:
- building new features
- fixing bugs
- optimizing performance


## Resources
In addition to the code and instructions provided in this repository, there is access to a number of resources to help succeed in the virtual experience program. These resources may include online documentation, chat forums, and video tutorials.
